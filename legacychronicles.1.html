      <p>When I first decided to quit teaching to become a full time writer, I had ideas for more than one series of books.
       The first was based on my experiences in the classroom and would have covered my entire teaching career.
       The second was based on the stories of how various couples in my family met and fell in love.</p>
    <p>As I began to talk through what I had in mind with my family, however,
       an entirely different story kept forcing its way to the front of my thoughts.
        A series based on the women in Moses’ life who displayed such inspiring acts of faith
         that they have always been amongst my favourite Biblical characters.</p>
    <p> The concept grew to include my love of science-fiction and fantasy,
       fleshing out without much conscious input on my part.
        It felt like these stories wanted to be told and wouldn’t leave me alone until I’d written them,
         even waking me in the middle of the night with new details. I caved.
       I put aside my original plans and followed the call to write The Legacy Chronicles.</p>
       <p>I can only hope that you enjoy reading them as much as I have enjoyed putting them to paper.
          The characters of the Esarelian Empire and beyond live in a time and place where choosing faith in God
           over scientific understanding and personal advancement is difficult and often dangerous.
          The results are… well, why don’t you find out for yourself?</p>

      <p>  This book can be read on several levels.
        On one, it is a stunning and spiritually uplifting reworking of a well-known tale from the bible.
        However it is also a thrilling and passionate adventure story which can be enjoyed for itself.
        I highly recommend this accomplished and extremely enjoyable book,
        and I’m very much looking forward to the next in the series.”

        <p>“Salisbury gives her readers a place to explore, imagine, and relate to biblical characters…
          and possibly, to learn something new. I’m looking forward to the next one! I think you will too.”
