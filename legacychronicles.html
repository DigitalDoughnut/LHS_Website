      <p> When I first decided to quit teaching to become a full time writer, I had ideas for more than one series of books.
       The first was based on my experiences in the classroom and would have covered my entire teaching career.
       The second was based on the stories of how various couples in my family met and fell in love.</p>
    <p>As I began to talk through what I had in mind with my family, however,
       an entirely different story kept forcing its way to the front of my thoughts.
        A series based on the women in Moses’ life who displayed such inspiring acts of faith
         that they have always been amongst my favourite Biblical characters.</p>
         <img src="img/CourageConviction.png" alt="Legacy Chronicles Books" class="float-right ml-3 my-2" width=240px>
    <p> The concept grew to include my love of science-fiction and fantasy,
       fleshing out without much conscious input on my part.
        It felt like these stories wanted to be told and wouldn’t leave me alone until I’d written them,
         even waking me in the middle of the night with new details. I caved.
       I put aside my original plans and followed the call to write The Legacy Chronicles.</p>
       <p>I can only hope that you enjoy reading them as much as I have enjoyed putting them to paper.
          The characters of the Esarelian Empire and beyond live in a time and place where choosing faith in God
           over scientific understanding and personal advancement is difficult and often dangerous.
          The results are… well, why don’t you find out for yourself?</p>

      <p>  Can two people with opposing principles overcome their differences to be together?</p>
<p>
        Than has spent his life ostensibly having fun while secretly fighting for his people’s freedom.
         A member of the underground resistance, he is only ever serious around his comrades and his family.
          When an injury forces him to step down from active duty and his reluctant nurse sparks his interest,
           Than finds himself in uncharted territory. The fascinating woman will have nothing to do with him…</p>
           <p>        
        Menali’s past has taught her to keep her head down and trust that God has a reason for allowing the
         human race to suffer on U’du. When Than explodes into her life,
          he refuses to take no for an answer and challenges all of her preconceptions.
         He soon has her re-evaluating her priorities and wondering what life with someone like him would be like…

      <p>  First she fights to adopt her son; then she has to fight to keep him.</p>
        <p>Reemah is a Ra’hos. She has led a life of privilege and luxury, flouting the rules to suit her every whim. 
          Now she must face the consequences of breaking those rules to save a human infant. What will her father 
          demand in return for allowing her latest, most reprehensible, disobedience?
        </p>
       <p> Mahsan has grown up in a world where he doesn’t belong—always alone, always less than his peers. He longs 
         for a place to fit in, a place to be himself. Can discovering the truth about his past hold the key to his 
         future happiness?
        </p>     
       <p> Amidst court intrigue and deadly plots, will one mother and son out-manoeuvre unseen enemies to stay

        <p>Reemah stepped from the cargo bay of Buln, the transport tub she and Velay had requisitioned for their 
          illicit trips to U’du, onto the solid deck of the cruiser. She stretched her back to remove the kinks 
          caused by cycles in the pilot’s seat. Buln was possibly the least comfortable craft she had ever flown, 
          but it was worth the discomfort to be able to see her adopted human son, Mahsan. Sighing in relief, both
           at the familiar, comforting environment and at having returned once more without detection, she strode 
           out of the hangar in a random direction. </p>
        <p>Velay chased after her, their gear slung over her shoulder in a small pack. She made a sound in her throat 
          when they took the corridor leading to the exercise bay but caught up and strolled alongside Reemah without
           complaint. After a close call a few months ago, they had taken to wandering the cruiser as a cover for their 
           clandestine excursions and never returned directly to their own suite.</p> 
        <p>Reemah mentally reviewed the highlights of their visit to the planet. She had been pleased at the progress 
          Mahsan had made since she had last seen him four months ago. He was already speaking a few words and standing 
          on his own, and soon he would be toddling around, getting into trouble. If only she could find a way to bring 
          him aboard the cruiser, she would be able to see each accomplishment herself instead of relying on the reports 
          of the human nursemaid and guard she had assigned to look after him. She missed him greatly.</p>
        <p>Velay looked over at her and shook her head, evidently reading Reemah’s surface emotions. “Already, huh?” In 
          an undertone, she added, “I guess he does grow on you after a while.”</p>
        <p>Reemah chuckled at her friend’s admission but refrained from commenting directly. She knew how prickly a 
          subject her adopting a human child still was for Velay, despite his adorable nature.</p>
        <p>“I can’t believe how big he is now. I need to get him up here, Velay, as soon as possible. This is intolerable, 
          and we’re going to get caught if we keep sneaking out to visit him.”</p>
       <p>Reemah had been banned from space flight by her father, the Ra’hon of the Esarelian Empire, after an unfortunate 
         incident during an illicit arrow race a year earlier. It was during her first stolen cycles away with Velay that 
         she had found and adopted her son. She had instantly bonded with the boy, the only survivor of a culling of human 
         infant males, and had vowed to protect him from further harm.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, she had yet to discover a means of officially claiming him without disclosing her disobedience or 
        admitting to interfering with her father’s orders regarding their slave workforce on U’du. Still, whatever his 
        reason – and she desperately hoped the father she adored had a good one for such a barbarous act, or that the 
        order had originated elsewhere, unbeknownst to him – she could not condone the slaying of innocents. She would 
        do all in her power to ensure Mahsan’s survival and prosperity as a member of her family. Glumly, she reminded 
        herself that going against the Ra’hon was potentially suicidal, even for her, and that she had done little thus 
        far to prove her intentions towards her new son.</p>
     <p> “Don’t worry,” Velay replied, breaking into her musings. “We’ll think of something. We always do.”</p>
    <p>That brought a smile to Reemah’s lips. <em>Soon, my son</em>, she vowed, <em>soon</em>.</p>
    <p class="text-center">∞</p>
      <p>Nishaf waited impatiently for the pilot of the small boat, a private pleasure craft, to disembark and make his 
        way over. As soon as he was within two spans and out of hearing of the hangar crew, Nishaf barked, “Well?”</p>
        <p>“Hon Nishaf.” The male made a half bow of greeting before answering further, the mark of respect cooling
           Nishaf’s impatience somewhat. “The tracking device worked; they never knew anyone was following them.” </p>
        <p>A member of the underclasses, the young male had been in a gaming den when Nishaf had found him. After 
          providing training in several rather specific areas, Nishaf had utilised his natural talents on numerous 
          occasions over the last century. The male was of average appearance, able to blend in and move undetected in 
          many circles, and his unscrupulous tendencies made him perfect for the work Nishaf could not assign to others 
          within his employ. At his own request, the male had remained nameless and covert, but he was extremely loyal 
          to Nishaf.</p>
          <p>“And? Where did they go?” Nishaf demanded.</p>
        <p>The male frowned as he answered, “To U’du, Hon Nishaf.”</p>
          <p>Nishaf’s instincts immediately went on alert. The slave colony on that planet was primarily devoted to
             producing the highest grade uduin in the known universe, as well as manufacturing the newest space cruiser in 
             the Esarelian fleet. As chief scientific advisor to the Ra’hon, Nishaf had overall responsibility for the work 
             and did not relish an inquisitive Ra’hos poking around in his domain. </p>
      <p>Keeping his features neutral, he asked, “U’du?”  <em>What in the universe are you up to, Reemah?</em></p>
        <p>“That is the strange thing, Hon Nishaf. It sounded as if they were visiting humans.” </p>
          <p>Nishaf narrowed his eyes and scrutinised the male to determine whether he was being honest or had lost them and
             was inventing a tale to take the pressure from his own back. If so, it was a preposterous one to choose. He waved 
             for the underling to continue.</p>
        <p>“I set down after they disembarked and had to remain on the other side of a small ridge to avoid detection. They 
          were talking to a human male about a boy, asking how he had been since they last saw him.” </p>
        <p>“Boy,” Nishaf interjected sharply. “What boy?” Not only were Reemah’s movements nonsensical, it seemed they could 
          potentially prove disastrous to his plans.</p>
        <p>“I do not know; they did not remain there for long. When I could no longer hear them, I moved closer, but they had 
          disappeared. They must have entered one of the planet’s cave systems. I did not want to risk discovery by 
          attempting to find the entrance, so I returned to report instead, Hon Nishaf.”</p>
        <p>Nishaf ground his teeth at the missed opportunity; he craved more detailed information. While he would admit there 
          were several such systems on the planet, some natural and others man-made, he could not countenance Reemah evading
           his spy. When she became his, he would control her far better than her father had until now.</p>
        <p>Returning his attention to the male he had set to watch her, he debated whether or not to let the failure go 
          unpunished. After all, the male was ruthlessly efficient and had remained undetected, qualities Nishaf prized in 
          his employees. He had also discovered the destination of Reemah’s adventures on the tub.</p>
        <p>“Never mind, you did well. Remember to speak of this to no-one, though, or you will find yourself on U’du permanently.” </p>
          <p>The male’s jaw flexed infinitesimally, but he bowed and replied, “Of course, Hon Nishaf. You can be assured, 
            as always, of my complete discretion.”</p>
        <p>Nishaf dismissed him, already pondering his next move. Stalking towards the control station in the innermost corner 
          of the bay, he beckoned the female on duty with a flick of his finger in her direction. She scurried over, 
          pleasing him with her quick obsequious bow.</p>
         <p>“Was that Ra’hos Reemah I just saw leaving this hangar?” Nishaf asked in his most imperial tone.</p> 
         <p>Her eyes widened and her mouth gaped for a moment before she rushed to answer, “Yes, Hon Nishaf.” </p>
         <p>“Yet you failed to report her presence here to the Ra’hon.”</p>
         <p>He did not need to say more. All control personnel knew of Reemah’s restrictions regarding travel beyond the 
           cruiser. The young female could be severely disciplined for her lapse and knew it.   </p>
          <p>“A-apologies, Hon Nishaf,” she stuttered. “I will do so right away.” </p> 
         <p>Good, she knew to use his honorific each time she addressed him. He held up a finger to forestall her and 
           studied her closely. She kept her face blank and her eyes downcast, but the twitching of her right hand as it 
           clasped the left in front of her gave away her nerves. He could use her evident fear of him to his advantage. </p> 
         <p>Unfortunately, acting now would be a waste of time as well as being counterproductive to his plans. Reemah 
           had already returned to the cruiser and would no doubt have tampered with the internal sensors to show her 
           having never left. The word of a Ra’hos superseding all others, there would be no point in a useless 
           confrontation that would only tip his hand. No. He needed proof of her perfidy before alerting her father.</p>
           <p>“You need say nothing of her movements today now that I am aware. However, unless you wish to be found 
             responsible for aiding her in circumventing the Ra’hon’s decree, you will immediately report to your 
             superiors the next time she leaves this cruiser.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Hon Nishaf, of course.” Her full bow held slightly longer than necessary, causing his chest to swell 
            with pride. His reputation among the ranks of the underclasses preceded him and none would risk disobeying 
            his orders. As he swept out of the hangar, he congratulated himself on the morning’s work.</p>

              It’s clear that something on planet U’du needs to change – and soon!</p>

            <p class="pb-3  "> Let me also introduce Ra'hos Reemah, one of the Esarelian characters from Courage.
               Reemah fills the role of the Egyptian princess in the Biblical account of Moses,
                and more of her story is told in Strength, the third book in The Legacy Chronicles. </p>

              Position: Ra’hos (member of the Esarelian royal family).<br>
              Appearance: Tall for a female (8ft approx.), thin, toned, violet eyes signal Ra’hos lineage.<br>
              Attributes: Rebellious, intelligent, easily bored, great pilot, craves space and speed,
                 odd for an Esarelian – doesn’t like political games, feels stifled by her role,
                  dislikes sycophants, often lonely.<br>
