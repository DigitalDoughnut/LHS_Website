      <p> When I first decided to quit teaching to become a full time writer, I had ideas for more than one series of books.
       The first was based on my experiences in the classroom and would have covered my entire teaching career.
       The second was based on the stories of how various couples in my family met and fell in love.</p>
    <p>As I began to talk through what I had in mind with my family, however,
       an entirely different story kept forcing its way to the front of my thoughts.
        A series based on the women in Moses’ life who displayed such inspiring acts of faith
         that they have always been amongst my favourite Biblical characters.</p>
         <img src="img/CourageConviction.png" alt="Legacy Chronicles Books" class="float-right ml-3 my-2" width=240px>
    <p> The concept grew to include my love of science-fiction and fantasy,
       fleshing out without much conscious input on my part.
        It felt like these stories wanted to be told and wouldn’t leave me alone until I’d written them,
         even waking me in the middle of the night with new details. I caved.
       I put aside my original plans and followed the call to write The Legacy Chronicles.</p>
       <p>I can only hope that you enjoy reading them as much as I have enjoyed putting them to paper.
          The characters of the Esarelian Empire and beyond live in a time and place where choosing faith in God
           over scientific understanding and personal advancement is difficult and often dangerous.
          The results are… well, why don’t you find out for yourself?</p>

        Gilla and Elias have the perfect life—or as perfect as life can be for slaves living
         deep in the Esarelian Empire. Elias wants freedom for his precious wife and daughter,

      <p>  Can two people with opposing principles overcome their differences to be together?</p>
<p>
        Than has spent his life ostensibly having fun while secretly fighting for his people’s freedom.
         A member of the underground resistance, he is only ever serious around his comrades and his family.
          When an injury forces him to step down from active duty and his reluctant nurse sparks his interest,
           Than finds himself in uncharted territory. The fascinating woman will have nothing to do with him…</p>
           <p>        
        Menali’s past has taught her to keep her head down and trust that God has a reason for allowing the
         human race to suffer on U’du. When Than explodes into her life,
          he refuses to take no for an answer and challenges all of her preconceptions.
         He soon has her re-evaluating her priorities and wondering what life with someone like him would be like…

        <p>Nali was in Than’s arms, and he was spinning her around in circles. Shadowed grey walls and flashes 
          of evening sunlight alternated behind her, flickering in the periphery as they turned. Her eyes shone 
          with dizzy delight, her smile dazzling his wits. His favourite pastime was bringing that smile to her 
          precious face. As they came to a standstill, he tickled her until she begged him to stop, doubled over 
          and panting through her squeals. Wrapping his arms around her once more, he breathed in the clean scent 
          of her hair and cherished the feel of her head tucked safely under his chin and against the steady rhythm 
          of his heart. He turned them towards the window where the setting sun lit the sky on fire as it melted 
          into the distant mountain peaks.</p>
        <p>On the edge of the settlement, their new shack gave them an uninterrupted view of the landscape beyond. 
          They loved to watch it kaleidoscope from pale grey through a rosy yellow glow to vivid slashes of red 
          and orange before sinking into dark charcoals and the silver edged black of night. Soon, the twin moons 
          would begin to reflect off the surface of the mirror-like lake that peeked out from behind the neighbouring 
          shack to the north. His life with her was perfect. Releasing a contented sigh to float heavenward, he 
          relaxed into the warmth of his wife’s embrace.</p> 
          <p>The air was still and silent, as if the planet itself was preparing for slumber. The stench of 
            labouring bodies, fusing metal, and uduin vats was far behind them, emanating from the work sectors 
            and closely packed quarters in the settlement proper. Out here that odour was replaced by air tinged 
            only with the mild sour flavour of the mineral-rich, purple water—as long as no wind storms brought 
            choking dust their way. He had chosen the quiet spot, away from the hustle and bustle of the settlement 
            centre, for that very reason.</p>
            <p>One day their peace and solitude would be threatened by the drill of foundations and the rumble of 
              walls being up-ended into place. New shacks would be built farther out into the wasteland as the 
              settlement spewed out another generation of married slaves. Until then, however, he would bask in 
              the way his wife looked on him as her personal hero for finding a relatively isolated place where 
              they could begin their simple life together.</p>
              <p>Planting a soft kiss on her forehead, he looked down at her and couldn’t believe his luck. She 
                could have chosen anyone, yet she was with him. Without any effort, she soothed his restlessness, 
                and for the first time in his life, he’d found peace. He could stand unmoving like that for an 
                eternity as long as he held her fragile form. Even though still a slave, in that moment, his life 
                felt idyllic.</p>
                <p>From the other room in their simple abode, the cries of a child broke their moment together. 
                  Nali disentangled herself from his body to see to their son’s needs, and he watched the gentle 
                  sway of her figure as she left him to tidy away their previously abandoned evening rations. As 
                  he picked up the bowls from the table, the sound of the baby’s screams suddenly intensified, 
                  causing his entire body to jerk with alarm.</p>
                  <p>He sat up and looked around, the wails fading into faint sobs coming from behind the door to 
                    his left. A sharp pain zinged through his shoulder when he moved, reminding him not to lie on 
                    the still healing muscles. Rubbing his hands over his face, he sifted through his confused 
                    thoughts. The dream slipped into the recesses of his mind and left cold reality in its place. 
                    He was on the sleeping mat of Gilla’s shack, and the space where his niece, Mirami, not Nali, 
                    should have been was empty. Gilla and little Elias were missing, and Mirami was no longer by 
                    his side. He pushed the tangled blanket away and rose to his feet to pad softly into the main 
                    room.</p>
                    <p>Mirami sat at the window, holding vigil, he knew, for her mother’s return. His throat 
                      constricted at how small, vulnerable, and lost she looked. Her knees were tucked under her 
                      chin, and she only twitched slightly at his approach. Occasional tears tracked down her cheeks 
                      as she cried. The sunlight beginning to stream through the partially open shutters picked them 
                      out for special attention, turning the liquid orbs into tiny prisms of light.</p>
                      <p>“Hey, Kiddo,” he said softly as he squatted down next to her and pulled her shaking 
                        shoulders into his side. She barely glanced in his direction. Her eyes were trained on the 
                        end of the passageway leading to their shack from the direction she presumably expected Gilla 
                        to appear.</p>
                        <p>He tried again. “How long have you been out here?”</p>
                <p>He thought she wouldn’t answer, lost in a trance of apprehension and longing for her mother 
                          and baby brother. Eventually, though, he felt her sniff and say, “Since a couple of cycles 
                          before sunup.”</p>
      <p>That explained the frayed blanket clutched tightly about her. Even indoors, it would have been chilly at 
        that early time of day. Than realised as he held her that he was out of his depth. He was the fun-loving 
        uncle who played games and took her on exciting adventures, not the father who consoled or gently reprimanded 
        when necessary. Before he could think of anything else to say, she spoke again.</p>
        <p>“Why isn’t Mama back yet?”</p>
        <p>The pitiful tone of her voice tugged at his heart and tightened the bands already circling his chest. He 
          didn’t know how to respond, wondering the same himself. Jumping on the first coherent possibility to flit 
          through his semi-awake brain, he said, “She probably needs time to make sure little Elias is safe. I don’t 
          blame her for staying away for a while after what happened yesterday, do you?”</p>
          <p>A pause followed, during which a considering expression crossed her features. At length, her shoulders 
            lifted slightly, and she shook her head. Not wanting to cede the sliver of headway he’d made with her, 
            he looked around the room and hit on his next tactic of distraction.</p>
        <p>In as cheery a voice as he could muster, he said, “Why don’t we clean up the shack so it’s ready for when 
          they get back? Come on,” he added with a knowing grin, “your mama won’t appreciate the mess we’ve managed 
          to make of the place; she’s only been gone for a day.”</p>
          <p>Soon he was wiping out the eating bowls and stacking them in the cupboard while Mirami swept the floor 
            with a bundle of garn twigs. Occasionally, the end of one broke off, and she bent to retrieve it, 
            stuffing each piece in her pocket with the others. The awkward broom was much shorter than the norm, 
            and even she had to bend over to be able to use it properly. He recalled Gilla asking Elias to make it 
            a couple of years ago after a particularly invasive dust storm and had to pull himself from the memory.</p>
      <p>Shaking out the rumpled blankets at the side of the shack was done twice due to Mirami informing him, in a 
        tone reminiscent of her mother, that his first attempt wasn’t good enough. He hoped that was a sign that she 
        was returning to herself and not still overly brooding. However, as soon as she’d finished folding and 
        stacking the spare jumpsuits neatly in their crate, his niece was back by the window once more.</p>
        <p>Than noticed her hands moving and, on closer inspection, discovered she was rotating and rubbing 
          a small pebble between her fingers. </p>
          <p>“Where’d you get that?” he asked.</p>
        <p>Her movements faltered for a moment before finding their rhythm once more. </p>
        <p>“Out in the wastes.”</p>
        <p>Her voice was small. Than realised when she must have picked it up, and his heart cracked a little.</p>
        <p>“Can I see?” he asked.</p>
        <p>After a slight hesitation, she shyly handed it over. It was warm from her handling and seemed smaller 
          in the palm of his large hand. He held it up to his face to get a closer look. A light streak cut the 
          rest of the bluer grey stone almost in half and the surface had been smoothed by the abrasive dust of 
          the wastes.</p>
        <p>She pointed to the markings and murmured, “The whiter line makes me think of God cutting through the 
          Esarelians one day. I don’t know why.” </p>
          <p>He pondered the analogy, catching her blush from the corner of his eye. With a smile and a shake of 
            his head at her perception, he tossed the pebble into the air and caught it before handing it back.</p>
        <p>“Good choice, kiddo,” he said as he ruffled her hair. “And that’s a great way of seeing the pattern—I’m 
          proud of you.”</p>
          <p>Feeling foolish for not turning to their maker sooner in his attempts to support her, Than held her 
            hand, the pebble encased between their palms, and prayed aloud for Gilla and little Elias’s safe and 
            speedy return. Unused to such open displays of faith since leaving his own parents’ shack, yet having 
            recently begun to rekindle his reliance on God, Than felt buoyed by the simple shared plea. He returned 
            with renewed hope to occupying his niece.</p>
      <p>Coaxing her into eating a small block of uduin took half a cycle, and going through what she’d learned 
        during her training in the med-wing whiled away another couple of cycles after that. He would have sent 
        her off to the Nursery, but he knew she’d refuse to leave and probably wouldn’t be missed in the aftermath 
        still engulfing the building. To clear out the bodies and erase all traces of the massacre would take the 
        sector workers days. In truth, he was glad she’d be spared that memory on top of everything else she’d been 
        through.</p>
        <p>By the time Aronin knocked on the door, the fourth person to check on Gilla’s whereabouts since Damaya 
          had stormed in earlier, Than was as worried as Mirami and nearly as fixated on the window. Aronin was 
          confident Gilla would choose the darkness of night through which to slip unobserved back into the 
          settlement. After saying as much to Mirami and watching her spirits lift as the observation settled over 
          her, he left a more positive Than in his wake as well.</p>

            <h3 class="pb-3 text-center">Reemah</h3>
            <p> Let me also introduce Ra'hos Reemah, one of the Esarelian characters from Courage.
               Reemah fills the role of the Egyptian princess in the Biblical account of Moses,
                and more of her story is told in Strength, the third book in The Legacy Chronicles. </p>
            <p>Name: Reemah, First Daughter of Ashal of Esarel.<br>
              Age: 256 at the start of the series.<br>
              Status: Single<br>
              Position: Ra’hos (member of the Esarelian royal family).<br>
              Appearance: Tall for a female (8ft approx.), thin, toned, violet eyes signal Ra’hos lineage.<br>
              Attributes: Rebellious, intelligent, easily bored, great pilot, craves space and speed,
                 odd for an Esarelian – doesn’t like political games, feels stifled by her role,
                  dislikes sycophants, often lonely.<br>
              Favourite expression: Solid!<br>
              Favourite activity: Racing arrows (military fighter craft).<br></p>
