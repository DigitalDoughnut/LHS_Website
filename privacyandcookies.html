            <h3 class="pb-3" style="color:black;">Privacy Policy</h3>
          <p>This privacy policy is for the website www.laurenhsalisbury.com, owned by Lauren H Salisbury, Author,
           and governs the privacy of anyone who chooses to use it. </p>
          <p>The policy sets out the different areas where user privacy is concerned and outlines the obligations &amp;
             requirements of the users, the website, and the website owner.
              Furthermore, the way this website processes, stores, and protects user data and information
               will also be detailed within this policy.</p>
          <h5 style="color:black;">The Website</h5>
          <p>This website does not collect any user’s personal data. If this changes at any point in the future,
             details of the steps taken to safeguard personal data will be added to this policy and consent will
              be requested before collection of such data.</p>
          <p>This website contains a link to a third party sign-up form for Lauren’s newsletter.
             See paragraph below for details.</p>
              <h5 style="color:black;">Email Newsletter</h5>
          <p>The owner of this website operates an email newsletter through MailChimp,
             used to provide subscribers with updates, information about products, and special offers.
              Users can subscribe through an online automated process via a secure third party link
               should they wish to do so but do so at their own discretion. Some subscriptions may be
                manually processed through prior written agreement with the user.</p>
          <p>When a user subscribes to the newsletter, they will be asked to provide a name and email address.
             The name is used purely to personalise correspondence from the owner of this website.</p>
          <p>Should a user wish to unsubscribe, they may do so via the clearly marked unsubscribe link at
             the bottom of any newsletter. Users may also unsubscribe from the newsletter by contacting the
              owner of the website at the address listed at the bottom of this policy.</p>
          <p>Users can change their preferences at any time via the clearly marked link at the bottom of any newsletter.
             This includes the right to be forgotten. In this case, all personal data relating to a user will
              be permanently deleted from the list.</p>
          <p>MailChimp’s privacy policy is clearly marked on the sign-up link. For more information on the
             MailChimp privacy policy, please visit the policy page of their site.
              A link can be found at the bottom of this policy.</p>
          <h5 style="color:black;">External Links</h5>
          <p>Although this website only looks to include quality, safe, and relevant external links, users
             are advised adopt a policy of caution before clicking any external web links mentioned throughout
              this website. (External links are clickable text / banner / image links to other websites,
               similar to www.kingstrains.co.uk or Kings Trains Models.) The owner of this website cannot guarantee
                or verify the contents of any externally linked website despite her best efforts.
                 Users should therefore note they click on external links at their own risk and this
                  website and its owner cannot be held liable for any damages or implications caused
                   by visiting any external links mentioned.</p>
          <h5 style="color:black;">Shortened Links in Social Media</h5>
          <p>This website and its owner through their social media platform accounts may share web links
           to relevant web pages. By default some social media platforms shorten lengthy URLs [web addresses]
            (this is an example: http://bit.ly/zyVUBo). Users are advised to take caution and good judgement
             before clicking any shortened URLs published on social media platforms by this website and its owner.
              Despite the best efforts to ensure only genuine URLs are published,
               many social media platforms are prone to spam and hacking and therefore this website
                and its owner cannot be held liable for any damages or implications caused by visiting
                 any shortened links.</p>

            <h3 class="pt-5 pb-3"style="color:black;">Cookie Policy</h3>
            <h5 style="color:black;">What are cookies?</h5>
            <p>Cookies are small text files that websites place on the computers and mobile devices of people who visit those websites.
               These files are then read by the website each time you return to the site.
                These text files allow a website to remember your device and how you interacted with the website.
                 This is useful for a number of different purposes, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently,
                  remembering your preferences, and generally improving your experience on the website.
                   For more information on the different types of cookies, see the links at the bottom of this policy.</p>
            <h5 style="color:black;">How does this website use cookies?</h5>
            <p>This website uses one first party cookie (a cookie that has been placed and is used by this website).
                It is used to remember that you have accepted the use of
               cookies on this website. This cookie is anonymised, and it cannot track your browsing activity on other
               websites. No other party can access the data in this cookie.</p>
                 <p>This website also includes third party cookies (cookies that have been placed and are used by 
                 other organisations). For example, the Youtube video featured on this website contains cookies that 
                 are activated when you click to view it. The owner of this website cannot access the data in these 
                 cookies and does not control the setting of these cookies. For more information on the third party 
                 cookies used on this site and how to manage them, please refer to the Google cookie policy 
                 (Youtube). A link to their cookie policy can be found at the bottom of this policy.</p>
                  <p>This website does not use advertising cookies or analytical cookies to track your use of the 
                  site, but be aware that the third party cookies may do so.</p>

            <p>This website also contains links to third party sites that may use cookies,
               including if you click to subscribe to Lauren’s newsletter. The sign-up page is run by MailChimp.

            <h5 style="color:black;">Disabling cookies</h5>
            <p>If you would like to restrict the use of first party cookies on this website, you can leave the 
              pop-up active. Please be aware that this will not restrict the third party cookies activated if you click
